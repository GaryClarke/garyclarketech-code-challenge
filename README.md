# Code Challenge
From [garyclarke.tech](https://www.garyclarke.tech)

### The Mission!
Here are the code challenges to accompany my social media posts and subscriber emails. These challenges are all inspired by examples from my courses.

Be sure to check out [garyclarke.tech](https://www.garyclarke.tech) to learn more about all the cool stuff that I teach ðŸ˜Ž 

I hope you find the challenge that you're looking for. Let me know if there's anything you'd like me to add!

### The Rewards!
All correct challenge solutions get 25% discount off the course. Subscribers have the chance to win a FREE course every week...join in!

### Installation
These challenges don't require any dependencies, but I use a couple of dev dependencies to demo them. You can install with:
```shell
composer install
```

### Structure

The challenges are take from my courses, so I've tried to group them in folders named according to the course that they come from...which kinda works out but not as well for some examples which rely on namespace autoloading.
